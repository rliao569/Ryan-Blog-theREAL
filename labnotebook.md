# LAB NOTEBOOK! COOL

-Dates: 

8/20/23: I set up all of my programs.

8/21/23: Running into errors with bundle install, I reinstalled all softwares but still could not get progress.

8/22/23: This morning I finally got bundle install to work! Not only that, but the localhost works as well. The only issue I've encountered today is jupyter kernelspec list not being seen as a command in wsl. However, everything works for now. I am going to go through the process of pushing my first ever changes to github from VSCode. I sure hope nothing goes wrong! 

8/23/23: Today was much less stressful, and I learned how to customize my github page. I added an image, a schedule for myself, and even a video player; however, I realized that having a clickable video on localhost isn't something I can learn and do within a day. It'll definitely be a work in progress I will learn to do over the trimester. 

8/24/23: live review.

8/25/23: I learned the basics of Python. However, my laptop broke. This weekend I will have to somehow not fall behind...

8/28/23: I had to get a completely new laptop and set up everything again, however it was much easier this time. Today I had trouble running activate, and had a cooldown on my apt downloads. Luckily when I got home, I could run the commands smoothly.

8/29/23: I finally caught up. Time to code a quiz. I used Repl.it to have an interactive quiz on my webpage. Pretty cool stuff.

8/30/23: I added snake to my webpage!!!!
