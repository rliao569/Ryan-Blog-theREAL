    "Within the past two weeks, I have learned so much about computer science. Navigating through WSL, including using cd and install commands, were completely new terms for me. After learning about these commands, I can now confidently navigate from terminal to my VScode, and even help myself and others when running into errors. \n",

    "I made snake and added some color and control changes, I added a python quiz which runs through replit, and even got a working tetris. However, this tetris doesn't work on school wifi. The python quiz was arguably the most helpful, because it taught me a lot of the basics from python, such as else if statements, print, and basic JS terminology. Over this weekend, I plan to work on a functionl tic tac toe game with emojies and animations.\n",
