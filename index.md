## Overview of Hacks, Study and Tangibles
Blogging in GitHub pages is a way to learn and code at the same time. 

-Dates: 

8/20/23: I set up all of my programs.

8/21/23: Running into errors with bundle install, I reinstalled all softwares but still could not get progress.

8/22/23: This morning I finally got bundle install to work! Not only that, but the localhost works as well. The only issue I've encountered today is jupyter kernelspec list not being seen as a command in wsl. However, everything works for now. I am going to go through the process of pushing my first ever changes to github from VSCode. I sure hope nothing goes wrong! Hi
